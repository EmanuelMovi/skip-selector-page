# Skip select page

# What I Changed

- Rebuilt the layout with Tailwind and made it fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Used a gradient background with soft glow effects and subtle animations (pulsating blobs)
- Updated the look of skip cards — added better spacing, hover effects, and a glowing border when selected
- Redesigned the sticky footer with transparency and blur — made it more readable and subtle
- Redesigned the mobile stepper: no horizontal scroll, steps are stacked in two rows and easier to read

# Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- React (with Hooks)
